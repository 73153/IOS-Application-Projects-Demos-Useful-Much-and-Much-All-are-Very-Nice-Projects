/****************************************************************************************/ 
/**	
 This special view provides table views with the common pull-to-refresh functionality.
 
 Once pull-to-refresh is enabled in the table view model, this view will automatically handle displaying the pull messsage, inform the model that the table view needs refreshing, and return back to normal state after the table view has done refreshing its contents.
 
 Sample use:
    self.tableViewModel.enablePullToRefresh = TRUE;
    self.tableViewModel.pullToRefreshView.pullStateText = @"Pull to refresh tasks";
    self.tableViewModel.pullToRefreshView.releaseStateText = @"Release to refresh tasks";
    self.tableViewModel.pullToRefreshView.loadingStateText = @"Loading new tasks...";
