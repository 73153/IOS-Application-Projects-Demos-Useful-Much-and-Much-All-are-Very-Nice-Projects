ShakingAlertView
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukestringer90/ShakingAlertView.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukestringer90/ShakingAlertView)
![Pod version](http://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/ShakingAlertView/badge.png)

ShakingAlertView is a UIAlertView subclass with a password entry textfield. Incorrect password entry causes a "shake" animation similar to the OS X account login screen.

## Installation
### Cocoapods
Add to your Podfile: 

```
pod 'ShakingAlertView'
```

### Adding source code manually
Clone the git repo and drag the **"src"** folder into your project. This contains the UI components and cryptographic helpers necessary for hashing passwords.

## Usage
### Plaintext password

Use ShakingAlertView just like UIAlertView. For a checking a plain text password:

```
ShakingAlertView *shakingAlert = nil;
shakingAlert = [[ShakingAlertView alloc] initWithAlertTitle:@"Enter Password"
                                           checkForPassword:@"pass"];

[shakingAlert setOnCorrectPassword:^{
    // Code to execute on correct password entry
}];

[shakingAlert setOnDismissalWithoutPassword:^{
    // Code to execute on alert dismissal without password entry
}];

[shakingAlert show];
```

Rather than using a delegate, pass the instance a completion block to be executed for correct password entry and alert dismissal. ShakingAlertView uses ARC so no need to release your instances.

### Hashed passwords

ShakingAlertView uses the [Common Crypto](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011172-CH9-SW4) C API to hash the entered text to SHA1 or MD5. Therefore if you only know the hashed counterpart of a password string you can specify this along with the hashing algorithm type in the constructor. 

```
ShakingAlertView *shakingAlert = nil;
shakingAlert = [[ShakingAlertView alloc] initWithAlertTitle:@"Enter Password"
                                           checkForPassword:@"W6ph5Mm5Pz8GgiULbPgzG37mj9g=" //sha1 hash of 'password'
                                      usingHashingTechnique:HashTechniqueSHA1];
                                      
```

The hashing algorithm to use is defined by an enum and passed into the constructor.
```
typedef enum {
	HashTechniqueNone,
    HashTechniqueSHA1,
    HashTechniqueMD5
} HashTechnique;
```

`HashTechniqueNone` is used if no technique is specified, like in the `initWithAlertTitle:checkForPassword` and `initWithAlertTitle:checkForPassword:onCorrectPassword:onDismissalWithoutPassword` constructors. Here the entered string is compared with the specified plaintext password using a simple `isEqualToString:`  evaluation.

## Running the tests
The ShakingAlertView class is tested using the BDD tool [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi). To run the tests install Kiwi via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org), and the open the workspace: 

```
cd Example\ Project/
pod install
open ExampleProject.xcworkspace/
````

Make sure the **"ShakingAlertView"** scheme is selected then run the tests with **âŒ˜+U**
