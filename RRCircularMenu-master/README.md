RRCircularMenu
==============

RRCircularMenu is a Menu, slider and rainbow! All circular, animated and 100% Core Graphics (except for icons). As seen in [Run for iPhone](http://getrunapp.com).

Here is short demo video:

Requirements
---

RRCircularMenu has been developed against the iOS 6 SDK, but may run on iOS 5.

RRCircularMenu *does NOT use ARC*. To use this with ARC, compile with the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag.

Using RRMenuController
---

See the demo app for an example. It's pretty simple:

```
 //	1. Import the header
 #import "RRCircularMenu.h"

 // 2. Instantiate a menu object
 menu = [[RRCircularMenu alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, self.view.frame.size.height - 180, self.view.frame.size.width, 180)];

 // 3. Assign a delegate
 menu.delegate = self;
  
 // 4. Install in the view hierarchy      
 [self.view addSubview:menu];
 
 // 5. Display the menu 
 [menu 
   showWithAnimationBlock:^{
    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
   } 
   settingSliderTo:3];
```

The method `showWithAnimationBlock:` is used to reveal menu. The supplied animation block helps if you show the menu modally, so you can do things like prepare a view hierarchy for displaying the menu.

Items are set up in `RRCircularMenu.m`:

```
- (void) setUpItems {
    ...
    for (NSString *title in @[@"Time", @"Distance", @"Speed", @"HR", @"Calories", @"Route"]) {
        [self addItem:title from:currentAngle to:currentAngle + angleStep index:index++];
        currentAngle += angleStep;
    }
    ...
 }
```

Delegate used for all kinds of events:

```
- (void) menuItem:(RRCircularItem *)item didChangeActive:(BOOL)active;
- (void) menuLabel:(RRCircularMenuLabel *)label didChangeActive:(BOOL)active;
- (BOOL) ignoreClickFor:(RRCircularItem *)item;
- (void) sliderValueChanged:(RRCircularSlider *)slider;
```

Configuring RRMenuController 
---

This component is NOT really configurable, because it's kind of difficult to configure such menus. But you still can set colors, borders, change number of menu items and stuff like that. If you need whole circle of menu items, you'll have to dig into source code and change animations.
