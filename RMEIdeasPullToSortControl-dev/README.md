RMEIdeasPullToSortControl
=========================

RMEIdeasPullToSort control allows users to perform multiple custom actions when a UIScrollView is dragged to have a negative content offset. Although this control would work with any UIScrollView and can be used to trigger any type of action, it naturally lends itself to sort operations in UITableViews - hence the name RMEIdeasPullToSort control.

We created this control while trying to solve some of the challenegs we faced during the development of our latest app Back in Touch. Back in Touch enables users keep in touch with contacts who might be lost or forgotten in their ever growing phone book.
