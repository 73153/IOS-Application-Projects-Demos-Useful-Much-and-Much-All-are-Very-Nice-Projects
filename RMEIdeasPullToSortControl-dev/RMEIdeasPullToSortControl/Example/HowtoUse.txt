Please follow the steps below to use RMEIdeasPullDownControl.
1. Add RMEIdeasPullDownControl.h and RMEIdeasPullDownControl.m to your project.
2. #import "RMEIdeasPullDownControl.h" to your target file.
3. Adopt RMEIdeasPullDownControlProtocol and RMEIdeasPullDownControlDataSource.
3. Create a and initialize RMEIdeasPullDownControl property using the designated initializer.

    @property (strong, nonatomic) RMEIdeasPullDownControl *rmeideasPullDownControl;
    self.rmeideasPullDownControl = [[RMEIdeasPullDownControl alloc] initWithDataSource:self
                                                                              delegate:self
                                                                      clientScrollView:self.exampleTableView];
4. If you intend to place RMEIdeasPullDownControl behind the tableview (recommended) ensure that the background is transparent . . . else you wont see the control... :-)
5. Implement all the data source and delegate methods.

Thats all you need to do. Thank you for your time.

Please check out the app that inspired the creation of this control on the app store.
