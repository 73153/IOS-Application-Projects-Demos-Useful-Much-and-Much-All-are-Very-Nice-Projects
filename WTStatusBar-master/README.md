## Requirements
iOS5 or later, ARC

## Usage

1. Include `WTStatusBar.h` in your project
2. Call `[WTStatusBar setStatusText:]` or `[WTStatusBar setStatusText: animated:]` when you need to show status information. Progress value is cleared on each setStatusText call.
3. Call `[WTStatusBar setStatusText: timeout: animated:]` if you want to automatically hide status after timeout (like showing information message).
4. Call `[WTStatusBar setProgress:]` or `[WTStatusBar setProgress: animated:]` when you want to change progress bar value. These calls are ignored if status bar is not shown.
5. Call `[WTStatusBar clearStatus]` or `[WTStatusBar clearStatusAnimated:]` when you want to hide status.
6. You may adjust statusbar background color with `[WTStatusBar setBackgroundColor:]`. Color is applied with alpha 0.5 or 1.0, depending on statusbar translucent style.
7. You may adjust text color with `[WTStatusBar setTextColor:]` and progress bar color with `[WTStatusBar setProgressBarColor:]`.
