UIKeyboardCoView
================

A UIView to appear along the iOS default keyboard. It manages also ROTATION when keyboard is present. For iOS4+

The UIKeyboardCoView is totally CUSTOMIZABLE. Just add one UIKeyboardCoView in your XIB and put anything you need inside it :)

How to use
================
Just add it as a normal UIView programmatically or trough the Interface Builder.
It has also a delegate outlet to know when the Keyboard Co View did/will appear/disappear.

Finally, to manage keyboard rotations correctly, paste this code in your ROOT UIViewController willRotate and didRotate methods, like so:

	- (void) willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration{
    	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:UIKeyboardCoViewWillRotateNotification object:nil];
	}

	- (void) didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation{
	    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:UIKeyboardCoViewDidRotateNotification object:nil];
	}
