CSS-like image sprites for iOS apps.

REImageSprite is a simple `UIImage` category, there's only one task where you specify resource name and a sprite (which is essentially a `plist` file and a corresponding image file with the same name):

``` objective-c
+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)name fromSprite:(NSString *)sprite;
```

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `REImageSpriteExample` project in Xcode to see `REImageSprite` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `REImageSprite` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.15.2** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add REImageSprite:

``` bash
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'REImageSprite', '~> 1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `REImageSprite` files into your project, and add `#include "UIImage+REImageSprite.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
UIButton *button = [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(30, 100, 50, 50)];
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"YouTube" fromSprite:@"Icons"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"YouTube_Highlighted" fromSprite:@"Icons"] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
[self.view addSubview:button];
```
