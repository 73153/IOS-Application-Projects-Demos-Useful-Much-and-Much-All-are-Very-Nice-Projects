_Download and run the demo project to see it in action._

##What can it do?

`WUTextSuggestion` is still early in development, it currently supports **@ (at)** and **\# (hashtag, twitter style)** suggestions for `UITextView`.

------

`WUTextSuggestion` aims to be a full featured text suggestion toolkit for iOS. 

It can easily be integrated in your project with only couple lines of code.

It allows you to load text suggestions asynchronously from a remote server.

It is fully customizable. You can design your own text suggestion display controller to work with it.

##What's inside?

`WUTextSuggestion` is consists of two parts.

####WUTextSuggestionController

`WUTextSuggestionController` provides the text searching and checking function. It tells you when and how you should give your user text suggestions.

####WUTextSuggestionDisplayController

`WUTextSuggestionDisplayController`, a text suggestion display controller based on `UIMenuController`. It asks it's `dataSource` for the text suggestions, and display them beautifully on the screen.

##Usage

### A. The simple way, use WUTextSuggestionDisplayController.

Using `WUTextSuggestionDisplayController` to display text suggestions.

1. Setup.

	```
	//Create a WUTextSuggestionDisplayController and assign the dataSource.
	WUTextSuggestionDisplayController *suggestionDisplayController = [[WUTextSuggestionDisplayController alloc] init];
	suggestionDisplayController.dataSource = self;
	
	//Create a WUTextSuggestionController with a textView and the suggestionDisplayController you just created.
	WUTextSuggestionController *suggestionController = [[WUTextSuggestionController alloc] initWithTextView:self.textView suggestionDisplayController:suggestionDisplayController];
	
	//Set the suggestion type
	suggestionController.suggestionType = WUTextSuggestionTypeAt | WUTextSuggestionTypeHashTag;
	
	```

2. Provide the suggestions.

	You need to provide the text suggestions based on `suggestionType` and `suggestionQuery`.
	
	When a user typed `@na`, the `suggestionType` will be `WUTextSuggestionTypeAt`, and the `suggestionQuery` will be `na`.
	
	You need to wrap the suggestions in `WUTextSuggestionItem` objects, return an array of WUTextSuggestionItem.
	
	A `WUTextSuggestionItem` has a `title` and a `customActionBlock`. 
	
	`title` is the suggesting text. 
	
	`customActionBlock`, if assigned, will be executed after user tapped that text suggestion.
	
	```
	//WUTextSuggestionDisplayControllerDataSource
	
	- (NSArray *)textSuggestionDisplayController:(WUTextSuggestionDisplayController *)textSuggestionDisplayController suggestionDisplayItemsForSuggestionType:(WUTextSuggestionType)suggestionType query:(NSString *)suggestionQuery
	{
		//return an array of WUTextSuggestionItem.
	}
	
	```
	
	You can also chose to use `-textSuggestionDisplayController:suggestionDisplayItemsForSuggestionType:query:callback:` for async data loading.		
	
3. Done. **There's a demo project `WUTextSuggestionDemo`**.

### B. Working with your custom text suggestion display controller.

1. You need to use `- initWithTextView:` to create an instance of `WUTextSuggestionController`. 

2. The `textView` will hold a strong pointer to the `textSuggestionController` which can be acquired using `textSuggestionController` property of the `textView`.

3. Set the `suggestionType` property of the `textSuggestionController`.

4. Listen to the callback and present your custom text suggestion view.


```
//1.
WUTextSuggestionController *suggestionController = [[WUTextSuggestionController alloc] initWithTextView:self.textView];

//3.
suggestionController.suggestionType = WUTextSuggestionTypeAt | WUTextSuggestionTypeHashTag;

//4.
[suggestionController setShouldBeginSuggestingBlock:^{
	//"@" or "#" detected. 	You should prepare your text suggestion view.
}];
[suggestionController setShouldReloadSuggestionsBlock:^(WUTextSuggestionType type, NSString *query, NSRange range) {
	//User typed something after the "@" or "#", you should show your text suggestion view with suggestions.
}];
[suggestionController setShouldEndSuggestingBlock:^{
	//Suggesting end. You should hide your text suggestion view.
}];

```
