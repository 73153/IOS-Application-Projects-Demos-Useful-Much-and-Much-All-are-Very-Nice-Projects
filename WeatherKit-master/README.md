WeatherKit is a simple and elegant solution to obtaining local weather information via the [WeatherBug API](http://weather.weatherbug.com/desktop-weather/api.html). WeatherKit is built as a static library. Installation is as simple as dragging and dropping into your project. Using this project is even easier.

## Installation

Drag WeatherKit.xcodeproj into your project as a **subproject** (do not add it as a workspace). Open your *Build Settings* and add WeatherKit as a **Target Dependency**. Add the following Frameworks under **Link Binary With Libraries**:

* AddressBook.framework
* CoreLocation.framework
* libWeatherKit.a

Under *Build Settings* search for "linker flag". Add "-ObjC" (no quotes) to **Other Linker Flags**.

Next search for "search path" and set **Always Search User Paths** to "Yes" (no quotes). Also change **Header Search Paths** to "${PROJECT_DIR}/WeatherKit" (quotes).

I'd also recommend changing your scheme settings to build the library every time you run/build your project. I find myself tweaking my own, or other, libraries as I'm working on a project so everything is tailored to my needs. Click on your scheme and select *Edit Scheme*. Select the *Build* tab. Add WeatherKit to the targets. Uncheck *Parallelize Build* and drag WeatherKit above your project.

## Usage

### WeatherBug API

Firstly, make sure you have an API key from WeatherBug. You can obtain one [here](http://weather.weatherbug.com/desktop-weather/api.html). Make sure you are using the XML REST key in your app.

### Getting the Weather

The <code>WeatherKit</code> object is the main object you will likely be using. When initialized it will attempt to find the user's location and load the latest weather. <code>WeatherKit</code> objects also find the user's address (not just latitude/longitude). You have access to:

``` objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) CLLocation *currentLocation;
@property (strong, nonatomic) WKAddress *currentAddress;
@property (strong, nonatomic) WKObservation *currentObservation;

- (void)reloadWithCompletion:(void (^)(NSError*))completion;
```

### Conditions

I'm a little on the fence about how I do conditions. Based on th evast amounts of responses from WeatherBug, I've come up with some <code>typedefs</code> that take care of the problem. Conditions now default to <code>kWeatherConditionClear</code> if the response is unclear. Of course, this could lead to the possibility of a rare condition that results in the user seeing "Clear" when it *clearly* (ba-dum-tss) isn't.

``` objective-c
typedef enum {
    kWeatherConditionClear = 0,
    kWeatherConditionHaze = 1,
    kWeatherConditionPartlyCloudy = 2,
    kWeatherConditionMostlyCloudy = 3,
    kWeatherConditionOvercast = 4,
    kWeatherConditionFog = 5,
    kWeatherConditionThunderstorm = 6,
    kWeatherConditionSnow = 7,
    kWeatherConditionRain = 8,
    kWeatherConditionHail = 9,
    kWeatherConditionWind = 10,
} WeatherCondition;
```

These <code>typedefs</code> are also used for <code>NSString</code> representations (for labelling). See the following method for how the string is constructed.

``` objective-c
- (WeatherCondition)condition {
    WeatherCondition returnValue = kWeatherConditionClear;
    if (self.desc) {
        NSString *lowerDesc = [self.desc lowercaseString];
        // ...
    }
    return returnValue;
}
```

### Temperatures

There are 2 values for temperature, high temp, and low temp: raw and locale'd. The raw temperature is what is returned from WeatherBug which is always fahrenheit. The locale'd temperature checks the <code>NSLocale</code> of the user's device and returns the converted fahrenheit or celsius temperature.

``` objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSNumber *temperature;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSNumber *temperatureHigh;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSNumber *temperatureLow;

- (NSNumber*)localTemperature;
- (NSNumber*)localTemperatureHigh;
- (NSNumber*)localTemperatureLow;
```

### WKObservation

The property *currentObservation* on <code>WeatherKit</code> objects is of class <code>WKObservation</code>. If all you are dealing with is the user's current weather then you shouldn't ever have to deal with creating new <code>WKObservations</code>s. However, if you find yourself wanting to load observations for other <code>CLLocations</code> (you need the lat/lon to make a request).

## KVO & Notifications

Most of the classes included have properties to trigger KVO events:

``` objective-c
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL isLoaded;
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL isLoading; // not always included
```

There are also <code>NSNotifications</code> that are sent when locations, addresses, and observations are loaded.

``` objective-c
NSString * const kWKLocationUpdateSuccessNotification;
NSString * const kWKLocationUpdateErrorNotification;
NSString * const kWKAddressUpdateErrorNotification;
NSString * const kWKCurrentObservationSuccessNotification;
NSString * const kWKCurrentObservationErrorNotification;
```

If you are catching an error via <code>NSNotifications</code>, you can access the error in the userInfo dictionary with the following keys:

``` objective-c
NSString * const kWKLocationErrorKey;
NSString * const kWKObservationErrorKey;
```
