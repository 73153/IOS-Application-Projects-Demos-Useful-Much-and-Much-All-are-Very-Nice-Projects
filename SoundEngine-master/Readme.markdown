# Sound Engine
## An OpenAL based sound engine that allows you to play one background audio track, and multiple simultaneous sound effects.

This sound engine was born out of a simple OpenAL tutorial, available [here](http://www.gehacktes.net/2009/03/iphone-programming-part-6-multiple-sounds-with-openal/).
Since then it has been featured online in a couple of [different](http://www.raywenderlich.com/259/audio-101-for-iphone-developers-playing-audio-programmatically) [sites](http://www.musicalgeometry.com/?p=912). There's also an ARC conversion available [here](https://github.com/kernelpanick/SoundEngine).

Current Version: 1.1

Version History:
1.0 Initial Release
1.1 Fixed a bug with changing the pitch of multiple simultaneous sounds. 11/9/09
