Showy Sidebar Controller
====================

This is the Sidebar controller we built  in order to create Showy. (http://showyapp.com)

It uses UIView-Origami by XYstudio and is inspired by NSSidebarController by Nacho Soto.

It's really simple to use:

- Import files from `SHSidebarController` to your project.
- Add `QuartzCore.framework`
- Have fun with `SHSidebarController`

LICENSE
--------
It has no license. You can use the code however you want and edit whatever you want.

If you use it in your project, mention me on twitter (@izqui9). I'd love to see  what you use it for.

Forks and pull requests are welcome.
