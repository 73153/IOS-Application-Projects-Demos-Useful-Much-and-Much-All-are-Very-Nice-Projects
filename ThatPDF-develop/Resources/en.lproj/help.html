<title>ThatPDF In-App Help</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><b>Welcome to ThatPDF!</b></p>
<p>ThatPDF is an app that allows you to view, sign, and annotate PDFs on your iPad.</p>
<p>To get started, go into your Documents folder and add files from your cloud storage via the toolbar icon the top right. Once you have PDFs in ThatPDF, you can open them, as well as sign and annotate them.</p>
<p>ThatPDF integrates with Ink to make it easy to work with your PDFs in other applications, as well as to use ThatPDF when you want to sign or annotate a pdf from another app.</p>
<p>ThatPDF also supports <i>Open In...</i> from Mail and other Apps. In Mail, press and hold on a PDF attachment. When the popup appears, tap <i>Open In...</i> and then tap ThatPDF in the list. The document will open in ThatPDF and will also be found in the <i>Documents</i> folder.</p>
<p><b>Navigating Documents</b></p>
<p>To go to the next page of a document, tap in the right hand side of the screen near the edge (or swipe, or drag from right to left), to go back a page, tap in the left hand side of the screen near the edge (or swipe, or drag from left to right).</p>
<p>To zoom in, either double-tap with one finger in the middle of the screen or use a zoom in pinch gesture. To zoom out, use a zoom out pinch gesture. When zoomed in, pan the page around by holding your finger down and moving it.</p>
<p>To display the menu and page bars, tap once in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>To launch the current document with Ink, you can either double-tap with two fingers on the document, or press the Ink icon in the top right corner of the toolbar.</p>
<p>To quickly move around in a document, tap on the small thumbnails in the page bar on the bottom of the screen. You can also drag the slightly larger page thumbnail back and forth.</p>
<p><b>Syncing PDF Files</b></p>
<p>You need iTunes installed on your computer to be able to copy (sync) PDF files to your device:</p>
<p>1) Connect your device to your computer with its USB cable.</p>
<p>2) In iTunes, click on your device just below DEVICES.</p>
<p>3) Now select the <i>Apps</i> tab.</p>
<p>4) Scroll down to the <i>File Sharing</i> section and click on ThatPDF.</p>
<p>5) Click the <i>Add...</i> button and choose the PDF file (or files) that you want to sync (copy over) to your device in the <i>Open</i> window and click the <i>Open</i> button. iTunes will now sync the PDF files over to your device.</p>
<p>6) Open ThatPDF on your device and tap the <i>Documents</i> folder.</p>
<p>Please note that any PDF files that you sync over to your device will be backed up to iCloud if you have enabled that feature on your device. This could take some time and will use up some amount of your allotment of storage space.</p>
<p><b>Adding Folders</b></p>
<p>ThatPDF allows PDFs to be organized into folders. To create a new folder, tap the plus symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Enter in a new folder name and tap the <i>Done</i> button.</p>
<p><b>Deleting Folders</b></p>
<p>To delete folders (but not their contents), tap the select file symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Tap the folders that you wish to delete (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each folder) and then tap the delete folder symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Tap <i>Delete</i> to confirm the deletion. Any PDFs in the deleted folders will automatically be moved back into the <i>Documents</i> folder. To cancel folder selection, tap the cross symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar.</p>
<p>Please note that the <i>Documents</i> and <i>Recent</i> folders cannot be deleted, only renamed.</p>
<p><b>Moving PDFs to Folders</b></p>
<p>After having created a new folder, you can move PDFs from any other folder into it to organize your collection of documents.</p>
<p>For example: Tap the <i>Documents</i> folder in the <i>Library</i>. Tap the check mark symbol in the folder toolbar. Tap the PDFs that you wish to move (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each PDF thumbnail) and then tap the folder icon in the folder toolbar. Tap the folder that you wish all of the selected PDFs to be moved into. To cancel PDF selection, tap the cross symbol in the folder toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Recent Folder</b></p>
<p>The <i>Recent</i> folder keeps track of the most recently viewed documents (most recent to least recent). To clear documents from the <i>Recent</i> folder, tap the check mark symbol in the folder toolbar. Tap the PDFs that you wish to remove (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each PDF thumbnail) and then tap the folder icon in the folder toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Renaming PDFs</b></p>
<p>To rename a PDF, tap the check mark symbol in the toolbar when in a folder. Tap on the PDF that you wish to rename and then tap the keyboard icon in the folder toolbar. If you select more than one PDF, the keyboard icon will be disabled as you can only rename one PDF at a time. Enter in a new name, or edit the existing one and tap the <i>Done</i> button.</p>
<p><b>Deleting PDFs</b></p>
<p>To permanently delete PDFs, tap the check mark symbol in a folder toolbar. Tap the PDFs that you wish to delete (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each PDF thumbnail) and then tap the delete file symbol in the folder toolbar. Tap <i>Delete</i> to confirm the deletion. To cancel PDF selection, tap the X button symbol in the folder toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Status Bar</b></p>
<p>By default, ThatPDF hides the status bar to enable full screen document viewing. To have ThatPDF show the status bar when viewing a document, press the home button and tap on <i>Settings</i>. Scroll down to <i>Apps</i> and tap on <i>ThatPDF</i>. Tap the ON switch to OFF.</p>
