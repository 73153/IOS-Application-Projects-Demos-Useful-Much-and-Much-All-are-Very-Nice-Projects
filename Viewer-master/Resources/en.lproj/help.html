<p><b>Getting Started with Viewer</b></p>
<p>Before you can begin using Viewer to view your PDF files, you need to connect your device to your computer via USB cable and copy (sync) them over to it using iTunes. Once you have done that, from within Viewer, tap the <i>Documents</i> folder in the <i>Library</i>. Now simply scroll to and tap on the PDF document that you wish to view.</p>
<p>Viewer also supports <i>Open In...</i> from Mail and other Apps. In Mail, press and hold on a PDF attachment. When the popup appears, tap <i>Open In...</i> and then tap Viewer in the list. The document will open in Viewer and will also be found in the <i>Documents</i> folder.</p>
<p><b>Navigating Documents</b></p>
<p>To go to the next page of a document, tap in the right hand side of the screen near the edge (or swipe, or drag from right to left), to go back a page, tap in the left hand side of the screen near the edge (or swipe, or drag from left to right).</p>
<p>To zoom in, either double-tap with one finger in the middle of the screen or use a zoom in pinch gesture. To zoom out, double-tap with two fingers in the middle of the screen or use a zoom out pinch gesture. When zoomed in, pan the page around by holding your finger down and moving it.</p>
<p>To display the menu and page bars, tap once in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>To quickly move around in a document, tap on the small thumbnails in the page bar on the bottom of the screen. You can also drag the slightly larger page thumbnail back and forth.</p>
<p><b>Syncing PDF Files</b></p>
<p>You need iTunes installed on your computer to be able to copy (sync) PDF files to your device:</p>
<p>1) Connect your device to your computer with its USB cable.</p>
<p>2) In iTunes, click on your device just below DEVICES.</p>
<p>3) Now select the <i>Apps</i> tab.</p>
<p>4) Scroll down to the <i>File Sharing</i> section and click on Viewer.</p>
<p>5) Click the <i>Add...</i> button and choose the PDF file (or files) that you want to sync (copy over) to your device in the <i>Open</i> window and click the <i>Open</i> button. iTunes will now sync the PDF files over to your device.</p>
<p>6) Open Viewer on your device and tap the <i>Documents</i> folder.</p>
<p>Please note that any PDF files that you sync over to your device will be backed up to iCloud if you have enabled that feature on your device. This could take some time and will use up some amount of your allotment of storage space.</p>
<p><b>Adding Folders</b></p>
<p>Viewer allows PDFs to be organized into folders. To create a new folder, tap the plus symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Enter in a new folder name and tap the <i>Done</i> button.</p>
<p><b>Deleting Folders</b></p>
<p>To delete folders (but not their contents), tap the check mark symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Tap the folders that you wish to delete (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each folder) and then tap the minus symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Tap <i>Delete</i> to confirm the deletion. Any PDFs in the deleted folders will automatically be moved back into the <i>Documents</i> folder. To cancel folder selection, tap the cross symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar.</p>
<p>Please note that the <i>Documents</i> and <i>Recent</i> folders cannot be deleted, only renamed.</p>
<p><b>Renaming Folders</b></p>
<p>To rename a folder, tap the check mark symbol in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. Tap on the folder that you wish to rename and then tap the keyboard icon in the <i>Library</i> toolbar. If you select more than one folder, the keyboard icon will be disabled as you can only rename one folder at a time. Enter in a new name, or edit the existing one and tap the <i>Done</i> button.</p>
<p><b>Moving PDFs to Folders</b></p>
<p>After having created a new folder, you can move PDFs from any other folder into it to organize your collection of documents.</p>
<p>For example: Tap the <i>Documents</i> folder in the <i>Library</i>. Tap the check mark symbol in the folder toolbar. Tap the PDFs that you wish to move (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each PDF thumbnail) and then tap the folder icon in the folder toolbar. Tap the folder that you wish all of the selected PDFs to be moved into. To cancel PDF selection, tap the cross symbol in the folder toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Recent Folder</b></p>
<p>The <i>Recent</i> folder keeps track of the most recently viewed documents (most recent to least recent). To clear documents from the <i>Recent</i> folder, tap the check mark symbol in the folder toolbar. Tap the PDFs that you wish to remove (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each PDF thumbnail) and then tap the folder icon in the folder toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Renaming PDFs</b></p>
<p>To rename a PDF, tap the check mark symbol in the toolbar when in a folder. Tap on the PDF that you wish to rename and then tap the keyboard icon in the folder toolbar. If you select more than one PDF, the keyboard icon will be disabled as you can only rename one PDF at a time. Enter in a new name, or edit the existing one and tap the <i>Done</i> button.</p>
<p><b>Deleting PDFs</b></p>
<p>To permanently delete PDFs, tap the check mark symbol in a folder toolbar. Tap the PDFs that you wish to delete (a check mark will appear in the top right corner of each PDF thumbnail) and then tap the minus symbol in the folder toolbar. Tap <i>Delete</i> to confirm the deletion. To cancel PDF selection, tap the cross symbol in the folder toolbar.</p>
<p><b>Status Bar</b></p>
<p>By default, Viewer hides the status bar to enable full screen document viewing. To have Viewer show the status bar when viewing a document, press the home button and tap on <i>Settings</i>. Scroll down to <i>Apps</i> and tap on <i>Viewer</i>. Tap the ON switch to OFF.</p>
