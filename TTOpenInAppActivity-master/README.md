# TTOpenInAppActivity

`TTOpenInAppActivity` is a `UIActivity` subclass that provides an "Open In ..." action to a `UIActivityViewController`. `TTOpenInAppActivity` uses an UIDocumentInteractionController to present all Apps than can handle the document specified with by the activity items.

## Requirements

- As `UIActivity` is iOS 6 only, so is the subclass.
- This project uses ARC. If you want to use it in a non ARC project, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to TTOpenInAppActivity.m in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.

## Installation

Add the `TTOpenInAppActivity` subfolder to your project. There are no required libraries other than `UIKit` and `MobileCoreServices`.

## Usage.

- We keep a weak referemce to the superview (UIActionSheet). In this way we dismiss the UIActionSheet ans instead display the UIDocumentInterActionController.
- `TTOpenInAppActivity` needs to be initalized with the current view (iPhone & iPad) and a) a CGRect or b) a UIBarButtonItem (both only for iPad) from where it can present the UIDocumentInterActionController.
- See example project.

```objectivec
NSURL *URL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"empty" ofType:@"pdf"]];
TTOpenInAppActivity *openInAppActivity = [[TTOpenInAppActivity alloc] initWithView:self.view andRect:((UIButton *)sender).frame];
UIActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[UIActivityViewController alloc] initWithActivityItems:@[URL] applicationActivities:@[openInAppActivity]];
    
if(UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone){
    // Store reference to superview (UIActionSheet) to allow dismissal
    openInAppActivity.superViewController = activityViewController;
    // Show UIActivityViewController 
    [self presentViewController:activityViewController animated:YES completion:NULL];
} else {
    // Create pop up
    self.activityPopoverController = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:activityViewController];
    // Store reference to superview (UIPopoverController) to allow dismissal
    openInAppActivity.superViewController = self.activityPopoverController;
    // Show UIActivityViewController in popup
    [self.activityPopoverController presentPopoverFromRect:((UIButton *)sender).frame inView:self.view permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny animated:YES];
}
